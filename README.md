# todoeyflutter

## Description

This is a simple Todo Application.
I started building this app during The Flutter Bootcamp and added some features and modifications afterwards.

**During the bootcamp I only used the master branch (first 49 commits) as using Android Studio was new to me. All changes are splitted in branches!**


## Functionality

- a task can be added
- a taks can be deleted by swiping left and confirm
- a taks can be checked as done
- the app will show the number to tasks


**More features will follow in the future!**
